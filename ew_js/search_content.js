I believe in capturing stories that go beyond poses - stories that breathe, move, and reflect who you truly are. With over 10 years of experience behind the lens, Ive had the honor of photographing weddings, elopements, and couples from all around the world. Whether youre getting married on a sunlit beach, wandering through ancient villages, or just sharing a quiet moment under the olive trees, Im here to document it all - honestly, soulfully, and with heart. What makes my work different? I dont just take pictures. I create space for you to feel . To laugh, to cry, to hold each other close - and let your story unfold naturally, without pressure or stiff posing. I work discreetly, gently guiding you when needed, always with an eye for emotion, light, and connection. My background in visual arts and storytelling helps me turn every shoot into a meaningful experience. And if youre a bit camera shy? Dont worry - most of my favorite images were taken in spontaneous, unguarded moments. When Im not photographing, youll find me exploring Cretan nature, sipping espresso coffee, or chasing the golden light at sunset. If youre dreaming of a heartfelt, authentic photography or film experience during your time in Crete - lets make it happen. Lets connect - Id love to hear your story!
